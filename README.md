# APT_Project
The python project that helps mapping peaks of APT data as well use it to determine various parameters and extract infomration. The GUI software is built using PyQt5 library. I am  currently in the process of including all the fuctions developed in the last 7 months under Prof Tong Li with support from my employer Ruhr University Bochum.
